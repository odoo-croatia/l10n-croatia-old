Development and collaboration will be done according to 
- <a href="https://www.odoo.com/documentation/12.0/reference/guidelines.html">odoo coding guidlines</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/OCA/odoo-community.org/blob/master/website/Contribution/CONTRIBUTING.rst">OCA coding guidlines</a>

comming soon:
Modules we need:

- Chart of account : RRIF (RIF, TEB)
  - naming will be : l10n_hr_coa_#VERSION#
  - need to validate : 
      - accounts, account groups, account types 
      - taxes
      - fiscal positions

- l10n_hr_base 
   - base model data
- l10n_hr_account_oca
   - naming is intended as odoo app store candidate, 
     but we canot use standard name l10n_hr_account as it is already present in app store
     for verion 10.0 ( author UVID d.o.o.) but we do not find it usable for localisation
- l10n_hr_account_fiskal_oca 
   - naming same as above
